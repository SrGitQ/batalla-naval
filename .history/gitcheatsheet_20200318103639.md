git
The simple git command displays a menu of commands that we can use when
we need this tool
git init
With the init command we can initialize a repository in the folder where we are located
git config --global user.name to change the username
git config --global user.mail to change email
These are user configurations for our local git(does not affect the remote)
git help
Displays a brief description of the command we want to request information on how to use it
git add
Add the files that we point to the new version that we will then confirm and with a * we point out
all existing files in the folder
git add
git rm
This tool is very useful for deleting certain actions or files
git mv
We can replace a file name with mv
git status
It makes a state of the repository where we are located and shows us how our files and branchs are, if we place -s gives us a pretty summary.
git diff
With this command we can see what are the differences between the previous changes we made with add
git log
Displays a history of everything we have done in the repository with very important information
as users involved, heads or branches
git commit
Generates a version on the branch we are working on in the repository where we are located, we can write a message directly with -m "message"
git commit -m ""
git commit --amend
Bring the latest version so you can make changes to that version and upload it back to your repository
